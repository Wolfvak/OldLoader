# OldLoader
Boot FIRMs from old entrypoints.

## Instructions
Copy the FIRM of your choice to your SD card as `boot.firm`, then run OldLoader via the entrypoint of your choice (requires copying / setting up more stuff, ofc), done. Simple, no? Also keep in mind this is for advanced users only. Everyone else just refer to the Guide and get up to date on your 3DS hacking.
